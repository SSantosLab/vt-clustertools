The two post-processing routines that need to be run are
addMinority.py and addRest,py,
in that order I'm pretty sure.

For both of them, the routine to run is "do all"
as in addMinority.doall(dir) and addRest.doall(dir)
where dir is the path to the files that make up the universe.
You should take a look at those- they are simple loops
over the universe models.

Then to get the color -color plot,
run loadPop.doall(dir) which returns a dictionary
the code smass.py shows you how to use the dictionary
of splines...
or probably easier, take a look at 
Check.py which loads the files directly but which is
likely broken; the universe of files has changed, for example.
