This is where the output files from the TwoPointCorrFunction.py go.
The output.info file is the table containing the information about the paramters A and gamma for each redshift bin.
The plots are the following:
1)corrfunction_grid contains the two point correlation function plot for each z bin and its respective power law.
2)log_corrfunction_grid contains a log-log scale of the two point correlation function for each z bin.  
2)paramters_graph is a plot of theparamters A and gamma for each redshift bin with its associated errors. 
3)correlation_matrices shows the correlation matrix (for the two point correlation function values)for each redhsift bin.
