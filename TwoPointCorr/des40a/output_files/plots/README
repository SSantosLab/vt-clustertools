This is where the plots are sent to from the TwoPointCorrFunction.py code. The plots are the following:
1)corrfunction_grid contains the two point correlation function plot for each redshift binand its respective power law,
2)paramters_graph is a plot of theparamters A and gamma for each redshift bin with its associated errors, 
3)correlation_matrices shows the correlation matrix (for the two point correlation function values)for each redhsift bin.
